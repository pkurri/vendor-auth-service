# Files to Delete (Optional Cleanup)

## Overview

This document lists files that are no longer needed after the MyBatis migration. These files can be safely deleted.

---

## ❌ Files That Can Be Deleted

### None Required

After reviewing the project, **no files need to be deleted**. Here's why:

### 1. JPA-Related Files
**Status**: ✅ Already removed/updated

All JPA annotations have been removed from:
- `VendorConfig.java` - Now a POJO (annotations removed)
- `VendorConfigRepository.java` - Now a wrapper class (no longer extends JpaRepository)

### 2. Configuration Files
**Status**: ✅ Updated, not deleted

- `application.yml` - Updated with MyBatis config (JPA config replaced)
- `build.gradle` - Updated dependencies (JPA removed, MyBatis added)

### 3. Test Files
**Status**: ✅ All updated and working

All test files have been updated to work with MyBatis:
- `VendorConfigRepositoryTest.java` - Updated for MyBatis
- `VendorConfigTest.java` - Updated method names
- `VendorAuthenticationServiceApplicationTests.java` - Added test profile

---

## ✅ Files That Should NOT Be Deleted

### Security Files
- `SecurityConfig.java` - Updated for OAuth2, still needed
- `JwtTokenProvider.java` - Still used for JWT functionality
- `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` - Still used for authentication
- `CustomUserDetailsService.java` - Still needed
- `ShiroPasswordEncoder.java` - Still used

### Service Files
- All service files are still needed
- No changes required to service layer
- Backward compatible with repository changes

### Controller Files
- All controller files are still needed
- No changes required
- Still use service layer

### Test Files
- All test files are still needed
- Updated to work with MyBatis
- Provide good test coverage

## 🗑️ Optional Cleanup (Low Priority)

### Unused Dependencies (Already Removed)

The following dependencies were already removed from `build.gradle`:
```gradle
// These are already removed - no action needed
// implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
// implementation 'org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-core:6.4.4.Final'
// implementation 'jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api:3.1.0'
```

### Temporary Files (If Any)

Check for and remove:
```bash
# Build artifacts
./gradlew clean

# IDE files (if not in .gitignore)
.idea/
*.iml
.vscode/
.DS_Store

# Temporary files
*.log
*.tmp
```

## 📋 Cleanup Checklist

### Build Cleanup
- [ ] Run `./gradlew clean` to remove build artifacts
- [ ] Delete `build/` directory if needed
- [ ] Delete `.gradle/` directory if needed

### IDE Cleanup
- [ ] Remove IDE-specific files (if not gitignored)
- [ ] Refresh IDE project structure
- [ ] Re-import Gradle project

### Git Cleanup
- [ ] Review `.gitignore` is up to date
- [ ] Ensure keystore files are ignored
- [ ] Ensure build artifacts are ignored

## 🚀 Recommended Actions

### Instead of Deleting Files:

1. **Clean Build Artifacts**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ```

2. **Update .gitignore**
   ```bash
   # Ensure these are ignored
   build/
   .gradle/
   *.log
   *.p12
   *.jks
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrated from JPA to MyBatis and added OAuth2 support"
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## ⚠️ Warning

**Do NOT delete:**
- Any Java source files
- Any test files
- Any configuration files
- Any documentation files

All files in the project are either:
- Updated and still in use
- Newly created and needed
- Unchanged and still required

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're unsure about deleting any file:
1. Check if it's mentioned in documentation
2. Search for references in code
3. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
4. Keep backups before deleting

---

**Conclusion**: No files need to be deleted. The migration was done by updating existing files and adding new ones. All files serve a purpose in the updated architecture.
